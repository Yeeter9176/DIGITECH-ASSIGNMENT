    <h2>What are the symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to<br />
            common illnesses such as a cold or influenza.<br />
            You may have one or more of the following:<br />
            <br />
            <b>a cough<br />
            a high temperature (at least 38˚C)<br />
            a sore throat<br />
            sneezing and runny nose<br />
            temporary loss of smell.</b><br />
            <br />
            Shortness of breath is a sign of possible pneumonia and requires immediate medical attention.
        </p>


        </p>
        <h2>How long does it take to show symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            Symptoms can take up to 14 days to show after<br />
            a person has been infected. The virus can be<br />
            passed onto others before they know they have<br />
            it – from up to two days before symptoms develop.<br />
        </p>

    <h2>Who has a higher risk of infection?</h2>
    <p>People with underlying health conditions are most at risk of COVID-19<br /> 
        becoming a severe illness. You are more vulnerable if you are over<br />
        70 years old with a health condition, living in an aged care facility<br />
        where spread can occur more easily, have a medical condition and/or<br />
        compromised immunity.<br />
        <br />
        Pregnant women in their third trimester when demands on the mother for<br />
        oxygen are higher, should also be cautious and follow good hygiene practices.<br />
        If you’re working where there is high risk of exposure to COVID-19 you should<br />
        talk with your employer to assess risk and options for working differently if<br />
        needed.
