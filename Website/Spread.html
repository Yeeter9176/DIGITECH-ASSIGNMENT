    <h2>How is it spread?</h2>
    <p>The virus is similar to the flu. This is because it spreads from<br />
        person to person through droplets containing the virus, these <br />
        droplets are from when an infected person speaks, coughs or <br />
        sneezes and these droplets can either infect someone dirctly, <br />
        or they can settle on a surface and an unsuspecting person <br />
        can get into contact with them, then touch their face and <br />
        become infected. The virus can remain infectious on tehse <br />
        surfaces for days (depending on the surface) and as such <br />
        pose a threat for anyone that comes into contact with them.<br />
